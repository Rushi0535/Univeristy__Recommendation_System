# University Recommendation System

This project aims to develop a university recommendation system based on user inputs and requirements.The system utilizes the supervised machine learning.
With some explicit programming, k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is uesd to provide personalized recommendations to the users .

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dummy dataset used for training the KNN model.
- `models/`: Includes the KNN model implementation.
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- `recommendation_system.py`: Main script to run the recommendation system.

## Installation

To run the university recommendation system, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- scikit-learn library
- pandas library

You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a dummy dataset created for demonstration purposes. It includes various attributes of universities such as location, ranking, tuition fees, and programs offered.

## Usage

To use the recommendation system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

2. Navigate to the project directory:
      cd university-recommendation-system

3. Run the recommendation system script:
      python recommendation_system.py
  
4. Enter your inputs and requirements when prompted by the system.

5. The recommendation system will provide a list of universities based on your inputs and requirements.


## Contributing

4. Push to the branch:
    git push origin feature/your-feature
  
5. Create a pull request on GitHub.
  
## Acknowledgments

- This project is inspired by the need to simplify the university selection process for students.
- Thanks to the scikit-learn and pandas libraries for providing the necessary tools for implementing the recommendation system.
